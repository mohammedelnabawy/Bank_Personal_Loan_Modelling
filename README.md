# Bank_Personal_Loan_Modelling
Hello,<br> <br>
In this project we worked on Bank_Personal_Loan_Modelling dataset to classify the clients into two classes (take loan or not) <br> 
and predict if the new client is likely to take a loan or not <br>
<br> 
On our work used five kind of algorithms to the find algorithm with highest f1_score <br>  
LogisticRegression <br> 
KNeighborsClassifier <br> 
DecisionTreeClassifier <br> 
RandomForestClassifier <br> 
VotingClassifier<br>
<br> 
And <br>  
In the end, we found Voting Classifier is the best algorithm. <br> 
with accurecy score = 97.53 % <br> 
and with f1_score = 98 %
